 # 🏥 Socio-Economic Analysis at County Level (USA, 2024)

This project presents a comprehensive socio-economic and public health analysis across **U.S. counties**, focusing on disparities in **health outcomes**, **economic conditions**, **intoxication behaviors**, and **environmental factors**. It aims to inform data-driven policy recommendations to bridge community health and equity gaps.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze how income, housing costs, and unemployment affect **life expectancy and mortality**.
- Study the impact of **environmental pollution** and access to care on public health.
- Examine links between **intoxication behaviors** (e.g., smoking, alcohol, drugs) and health outcomes.
- Identify counties with the highest **socioeconomic and health disparities**.
- Enable **targeted intervention planning** using statistical modeling and geographic visualization.

## 📂 Data Source

- 📊 Dataset: [County Health Rankings – 2024](https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/sites/default/files/media/document/2024_county_health_release_data_-_v1.xlsx)
- 💡 Data includes:
  - Health factors (life expectancy, mortality, disease rates)
  - Economic metrics (income, unemployment, housing burden)
  - Environmental data (air pollution, water access)
  - Behavioral risks (smoking, alcohol, drug use)
  - Healthcare access and insurance coverage

## 🔍 Key Research Questions

1. How do **economic factors** influence public health at the county level?
2. What is the role of **pollution and environment** in determining mortality?
3. Are **risky behaviors** statistically associated with poor health outcomes?
4. Which counties show the **most alarming disparities**?

## 🔧 Methodology

- **Data Cleaning** and normalization from multi-sheet Excel files
- **Descriptive Analysis** for baseline comparisons
- **Correlation Matrices** to identify strong associations
- **Statistical Modeling** (e.g., regression) for prediction and causality
- **Geographic Mapping** of disparities using county-level data
- **Policy Suggestions** based on empirical findings

## 📈 Key Features & Tools

- 📍 Visualization: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`
- 🗺️ Mapping: County-level choropleths using `geopandas` & `folium`
- 📉 Analysis: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, statistical summaries
- 🔄 Multi-dimensional comparison of social, economic, and health features

---

## 📌 Insights & Takeaways

- Counties with **high poverty and housing burden** face lower life expectancy.
- **Air pollution and healthcare access** show significant correlation with mortality.
- **Intoxication-related behaviors** (drug use, smoking) are consistently linked to higher death rates.
- Wide **state-by-state and rural-urban variation** signals need for localized interventions.
